# learning-js-exercises

Exercises for our learning js bookclub.


## Installation

You'll need node installed.
I suggest https://github.com/creationix/nvm or https://github.com/tj/n. Or just
go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and install 4.2.6.

After,

`npm install` to install all of the packages we are using on this project and
you're good to go!
